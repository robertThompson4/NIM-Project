// getServers.cpp
//  Given a socket, a broadcast address and a port number, this function returns the number
//  of TicTacToe servers as well as an array of structs.  Each struct contains the name, IP_Address and 
//  port number of a remote TicTacToe server.

//	IN parameters:
//	SOCKET s				= Allocated UDP socket handle that can be used for communcations
//	char *broadcastAddress	= The broadcast address that should be used for the current LAN
//	char *broadcastPort		= The port that should be used for the broadcast

//	OUT parameters:
//	ServerStruct serverArray[]	= An array that contains the structs.  The members of each struct
//							  contain the name, IP Address and port number of a remote TicTacToe server.
//	numServers				= Number of elements in serverArray[]

//	Function return value	= Number of remote TicTacToe servers (size of serverArray[])
